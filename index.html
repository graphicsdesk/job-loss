  When Chaitanya Reddy Gurijala, a student pursuing his master’s degree in computer science at Stony Brook University lost his internship, he knew he was not the only one looking for answers about job availability.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Looking to help others in a similar position, he took to Twitter and started the account @hiring2020. The account’s Twitter bio explains its simple mission: to provide “information about internships and full-time jobs for college students.” Gurijala is on a mission to collect and distribute information about which student internships and jobs are hiring amid the pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Since March 22, Gurijala has updated the Twitter account that now boasts over 3,500 followers and has created a Facebook page, LinkedIn, GitHub, and a website with crowdsourced information about the hiring status of internships and jobs. This is what Gurijala found:

        <p>It should come as no surprise to see job losses in the service sector and travel-related industries—these are some of the largest industries impacted by the pandemic. Thirty companies among the transportation and logistics; aerospace; sports and leisure; tourism; and hotels and accommodation industries have canceled internships.

        <p>In fact, 40 percent of all lost jobs reflected here are from companies with 1,000 employees or fewer, which in some industries makes them small businesses.</p>

  Canceled jobs, hiring freezes, and general uncertainty for the future have taken job opportunities from many students amid the COVID-19 pandemic—but this is just a reflection of a larger issue. The U.S. economy is entering a recession that threatens to be worse than any other in the past: the Great Lockdown. Small businesses across the country are in danger of closing, the unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the Great Depression, government responses are slow and hard to access, and experts are unsure of the path for recovery for industries impacted the most.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We are asking young people to do a lot here, which just seems kind of paradoxical because what we're asking most people to do is stay home,” says Caitlin Zaloom, a sociologist and professor at New York University, whose work focuses on the intersection of culture, student finance, and the economy. “But in staying home, they’re also sacrificing the lives that they could be building.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Studies have shown that students graduating into an economic recession tend to have lower incomes over time, take longer to establish their careers, and are more vulnerable to social consequences—like less-stable family lives and health issues later in life. Also, students who are not graduating this semester face other immediate concerns, including their ability to pay their student contribution for financial aid, which is a portion of tuition that students are expected to pay through scholarships, summer employment, work-study, or other jobs.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The uncertainty of what this pandemic might mean for young peoples’ futures—within specific industries, in the immediate future, or over the course of their lives—creates a far-reaching feeling of fear for all who are impacted.

        <p>Since March 7, the average job postings on LionSHARE, a job posting site for Columbia students hosted by Handshake, has been consistently low, as compared to average posting rates since September 2019. The only other time of year that experienced similar lows was late December—an annual period with historically low job openings and, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2019/11/26/hiring-slows-during-the-holidays-but-some-opportunities-remain/#26128dc776a4">according to Forbes</a>, with 26 percent fewer new hires than any typical month.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="step">
        <p>Of the job postings that remain, a larger percentage of them will be remote. Even so, the number of remote postings is still relatively small compared to all of the jobs advertised on Handshake. Further, not all industries can transfer to remote jobs.</p>

  There are not enough remote jobs on Handshake to draw a conclusion on the national availability of remote opportunities. The pre-quarantine norm for remote work, however, only included a minority of most jobs.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-working-from-home-privilege"> According</a> to the 2017-18 American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 29 percent of workers were able to work from home.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to that survey, finance, professional and business services, and information ( including Internet and software) are the three industries that employ the largest percentage of people who are able to work from home in non-pandemic times. Meanwhile, leisure, hospitality, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting are the industries that are the least able to transition to remote work.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  At Columbia, economics and computer science are the most popular fields of study, so jobs in finance, business, and technology are common pathways for graduates. In fact, software engineering, business analytics, and management consulting are among the most common fields for jobs posted on Handshake.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  These figures are likely to change because of how COVID-19 has pushed workers who would not ordinarily have the opportunity to work from home find creative ways to do so. They also reflect the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on certain industries.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “How we’re going to understand this going forward and the uncertainty there really is quite extreme because it isn't only that there will be fewer jobs … we’re heading into a massive economic contraction,” Zaloom said. “But the question is going to be: What is the distribution of jobs that are there and still available to people?”

        <p data-industries="Tourism; Hotels &amp; Accommodation; Restaurants &amp; Food Service">The industries that have had the biggest decrease relative to other industries in daily postings are not a surprise—the bottom three are restaurants and food service, hotels and accommodation, and tourism.</p>

  These are industries that Alexander Hertel-Fernadez, a political economist and associate professor who studies relationships between business, labor, and public policy at the School of International and Public Affairs, thinks will face some of the largest changes over time.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “And the question is: Will we still have places like Las Vegas in two years? For instance, given that people may be really uncomfortable being in large social gatherings like that, will people still be comfortable taking long, international trips with hundreds of people on a plane tightly together?” Hertel-Fernadez asks.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Sandy Black, an economics professor whose research focuses on labor and education at the School of International and Public Affairs, adds that the service industry, especially in comparison to other industries, has an uncertain future after the pandemic. She says, the tech industry, for example, will be able to adapt easily, “Whereas anything to do with the service sector is struggling to figure out kind of what their future looks like.“
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The tech industry is an interesting case as it is one of the few cases with increased consumer demand. Tech companies, especially the largest ones, will likely recover quickly from the pandemic. Black goes on to point out some examples of how tech has grown in the pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Who had heard of Zoom before this? Now everyone's using Zoom. The idea of telehealth, the healthcare market online, is something that hasn't really been exploited much, but now I think i'll probably kind of become much bigger going forward once people start adopting that kind of technology,” Black said. “Things like technological adaptation, all the tech industry is probably going to have a whole lot of demand now.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Telemedicine answers some of the questions of what healthcare will look like in the future. Healthcare has been harder hit in the number of Handshake postings, but as Zaloom notes, it might be more appreciated than ever. “There are certain professions, it seems to me, that are going to be seen as more and more essential, but which also happened to be professions that were already on the rise, and particularly in healthcare.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Other health-related jobs seem to be relatively less impacted than some of those in the service industry. The medical devices industry is one of the few with a positive percent change in postings. Biotech and life sciences and research, while impacted, have not experienced a drastic change relative to the data for other industries.

  Getting a job immediately after graduation can set people up for the rest of their careers. “Graduating in a recession has very deep economic and social costs for individuals over their entire lives,” says Hertel-Fernandez. “In good times, the jobs that you get immediately after graduating from college are very important because they set you up for the trajectory that you're going to have going forward.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Black adds that even those who know what searching for a job looks like in a normal recession, an economic shutdown is a special, unknown circumstance. Health restrictions, shutdowns and  Hiring freezes and at many institutions, including Columbia and Barnard, makes the job search even harder.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think this is the case where we know that it's hard during the recession and you take less desirable jobs and it makes it harder to get caught up to people who start out their careers in better times. But this is the additional problem of, there aren't even really jobs to find because of the pandemic. And so I think we don't know what the consequences are going to be.”

  On April 14, Barnard announced that it would waive its summer contribution for incoming and returning students in light of the pandemic. Since the fall, Heven Haile, a Columbia College junior, and Colby King, a Columbia College sophomore, have been leading the charge to similarly eliminate the student contribution for Columbia College students on financial aid.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Haile and King have been collecting testimonials from students in an effort to get rid of the student contribution, but the pandemic has added urgency to this push for reform. “It's really shitty that it took a pandemic to finally make some progress on this,” Haile says. As students lose jobs that would have helped pay their contribution, that cost will be even harder for some to afford this coming semester. Haile hopes that the pandemic will lead to the long-term abolishment of the student contribution, as well as to more changes in other aspects of financial aid.
